  - Open a new bank account.
  - Debit and credit money from an account.
  - Transfer money between accounts.
  - Check account balance.

## Requirements

- **Java JDK**: Version 8 or higher.

- **JDBC Driver**: MySQL Connector/J (JDBC Driver for MySQL).

## Setup

### 1. **Database Setup**

    email VARCHAR(100),
    balance DECIMAL(10, 2) DEFAULT 0.00,
    security_pin VARCHAR(10),
    FOREIGN KEY (email) REFERENCES User(email)
);
```

### 2. **Configuration**

  ```java
  private static final String url = "jdbc:mysql://localhost:3306/banking_system";
  private static final String username = "root";
  private static final String password = "your_password";
  ```

### 3. **Compilation**

Navigate to the directory containing the `BankingManagementSystem` package and compile all Java files:

```bash
javac BankingManagementSystem/*.java
```
